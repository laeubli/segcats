'''
Converts a TranslogII-style XML document into an observation sequence to be used for
model training and sequence tagging with segcats.
---
NOTE: All adaptors implemented can handle pauses in recorded translation sessions; events
and windows are only counted/computed inside <startSession>...<endSession> blocks. For
window-based parametrisation, this means that the length of windows at the boundaries of
such blocks may vary, i.e., the last window may be shorter than the defined window length.

            Example: ['keydown', 'fixation']
        @param parametrisation (str): The way how user activity data (UAD) in the XML
            will be parametrised; one of
            'event-based':  each event forms one observation
            'window-based': the UAD is split into windows of length @param window_length
            and events are accumulated in each window; that is, each window forms one
            observation
