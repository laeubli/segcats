'''
Converts a TranslogII-style XML document into an observation sequence to be used for
model training and sequence tagging with segcats.
---
NOTE: All adaptors implemented can handle pauses in recorded translation sessions; events
and windows are only counted/computed inside <startSession>...<endSession> blocks. For
window-based parametrisation, this means that the length of windows at the boundaries of
such blocks may vary, i.e., the last window may be shorter than the defined window length.
